This repository contains lab 3 for CISC 3140 where the goal is to work with terminal, awk, and makefile to sort through data on a csv file and return meaningful results from that data.
Steps in downloading Lab: 
1. First create the files in your terminal in a new directory so the files are able to easily be downloaded without any errors. This includes Makefile, awk, and csv file.
2. Make sure you switch to that directory and from there type in the terminal curl -o [filename] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhmedS12899/Lab3Ahmed/main/[filename]
3. An example would be curl -o nba2019-2020 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhmedS12899/Lab3Ahmed/main/[nba2019-2020]. Once you do this with all the files you can move on. 
4. Now once you have everything added to your directory from the github you can just type make in the terminal and it will execute the makeFile and produce an output.
